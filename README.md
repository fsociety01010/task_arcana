## Also you have the list of the city to see the list of houses in certain city. When u will click on the city u will see the list of houses in this city

## U can click on the name of author and u will see more details about him and also all his announcements.
## User can edit/delete only his own announcements.
## User can update only his own information.
## U can click on the name of announcements to see more info about him.
## User can create an announcement

## To run the server you need to have installed flask and SQLAlchemy
## After just run next commands in the Terminal/Shell
# For Linux
> 1) export FLASK_APP=app
> 2) flask run


# For Windows
> 1) set FLASK_APP=app
> 2) flask run

# The server starts at next adress
> http://127.0.0.1:5000/
